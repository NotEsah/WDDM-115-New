            <p>Think globally, act locally: as the effects of climate change become more real, that old adage feels truer than ever. Environmental stresses affect us most in the place we call home, whether weâ€™re breathing in exhaust from nearby roads, drinking from threatened waterways or trying to find some shade during more frequent Toronto heat waves. And home is where we start the work to mitigate the crisis, from building sustainable housing to preserving greenspaces to instilling a love of nature in our children. </p>
